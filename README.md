Official HeatWare Plugin for vBulletin
======
Since 1999, [HeatWare](http://wwww.heatware.com) has provided free use of its user feedback system, enabling forum users to buy/sell/trade with confidence. We have officially released a vBulletin plugin that allows forums to display user feedback statistics from HeatWare in the user's forum profile. HeatWare is a ***global*** feedback system, therefore there is no need to build reputation on EACH forum you visit.
